Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati




The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali succinctly outlines the art and science of Yoga meditation
for Self-Realization. It is a process of systematically encountering, examining, and
transcending each of the various gross and subtle levels of false identity in the mind
field, until the jewel of the true Self comes shining through.
This is an interpretive translation of the Yoga Sutra, expanding the number of English
words, so as to allow the practical instructions to be clearer. For example, sutra 1.2
defines Yoga with some 25 English words, rather than only 4 Sanskrit words. The
practices of the Yoga Sutras are extremely practical, though it can seem quite
complicated when trying to sort through the language. By providing expanded,
interpretive translations, the practical meaning of the suggestions more easily comes
through. The individual transliterated Sanskrit words also have a large number of
English translations, so as to give a more thorough understanding.
Commentaries on the Sutras are on www.SwamiJ.com, as well as other learning aids.
These include an extensive Introduction, a Main page presenting a visual outline and
summary of the entire Yoga Sutra, and a list of Reminder Questions, which serve as a
self-study guide.
When Patanjali codified, or compiled the Yoga Sutras, it was not that a new system
was created, but rather, the ancient practices were summarized in an extremely
organized and terse way. While the Yoga Sutras are thought to be as old as 400 BCE,
archaeological evidence and other texts suggest that the methods described in the
Yoga Sutras were being practiced as early as 3000 BCE. Oral tradition states that the
period may be even longer.
Yoga means union of the parts of ourselves, which were never divided in the first
place. Yoga literally means to yoke, from the root yuj, which means to join; it is the
same as the absorption in the state of samadhi. Sutra means thread, and this thread,
or multiple threads weave a tapestry of insight and direct experience.
Swami Rama explains, "There have been many scholarly commentaries on the Yoga
Sutras, but all the commentaries miss something very practical. Such commentaries
can only satisfy the intellect, but do not actually help you beyond that: 'yogash chitta
vritti narodha'--yoga is the control of the 'modifications' of the mind. Narodha means
control; there is no other English word for it. Control doesn't mean suppression, but
channeling or regulating."
In the tradition of the Himalayan masters, Yoga, Vedanta, and Tantra complement one
another, leading one systematically along the path to Self-realization. The aspirant
clears the mind through the practice of Yoga meditation as codified in the Yoga Sutras
of Patanjali, does self-enquiry of Vedanta, and then breaks through the final barrier
with Tantra, experiencing the heights of kundalini awakening.

Chapter 1: Concentration (Samadhi Pada)
What is Yoga? (1.1-1.4)
1.1 Now, after having done prior preparation through life and other practices, the
study and practice of Yoga begins.
(atha yoga anushasanam)
• atha = now, at this auspicious moment; implying the transition to this practice
and pursuit, after prior preparation; implying a blessing at this moment of
transition
• yoga = of yoga, union; literally, to yoke, from the root yuj, which means to
join or to integrate; same as the absorption in samadhi
• anu = within, or following tradition; implies being subsequent to something
else, in this case, the prior preparation
• shasanam = instruction, discipline, training, teaching, exposition, explanation;
Shas implies the imparting of teaching that happens along with discipline
1.2 Yoga is the control (nirodhah, regulation, channeling, mastery, integration,
coordination, stilling, quieting, setting aside) of the modifications (gross and subtle
thought patterns) of the mind field.
(yogash chitta vritti nirodhah)
• yoga = of yoga, union; literally, to yoke, from the root yuj, which means to
join; same as the absorption in samadhi
• chitta = of the consciousness of the mind-field
• vritti = operations, activities, fluctuations, modifications, changes, or various
forms of the mind-field
• nirodhah = control, regulation, channeling, mastery, integration, coordination,
understanding, stilling, quieting, setting aside of
1.3 Then the Seer abides in Itself, resting in its own True Nature, which is called Selfrealization.
(tada drashtuh svarupe avasthanam)
• tada = then, at that time; at the time of concentration and meditation
• drashtuh = the seer's, of the soul, witness, Atman, Self; from the root drsh,
which means to see (It is significant to note that Patanjali is not trying to
define who is the seer, or the nature of that seer. This is left to be answered or
resolved in direct experience.)
• svarupe = in its own nature, own form or essence; (sva = own; rupa = form)
• avasthanam = stability, settling, remaining, being in a state, resting, standing,
lying, abiding; the root stha means to stand

1.4 At other times, when one is not in Self-realization, the Seer appears to take on the
form of the modifications of the mind field, taking on the identity of those thought
patterns.
(vritti sarupyam itaratra)
• vritti = of the operations, activities, fluctuations, modifications, changes, or
various forms (of the mind-field)
• sarupyam = similarity, assimilation, appearance of, identification of form or
nature, conformity with the shape of; the root sa means with, and rupa means
form
• itaratra = elsewhere, at other times, when not in that state of realization above
Un-coloring your thoughts (1.5-1.11)
1.5 Those gross and subtle thought patterns (vrittis) fall into five varieties, of which
some are colored (klishta) and others are uncolored (aklishta).
(vrittayah pancatayah klishta aklishta)
• vrittayah = the vrittis are
• pancatayah = five fold (and of two kinds); panch means five
• klishta = colored, painful, afflicted, impure; the root klish means to cause
trouble; (klesha is the noun form of the adjective klishta)
• aklishta = uncolored, not painful, not afflicted, pure; not imbued with kleshas;
the root a- means without or in the absence of; hence, without the coloring
called klishta
1.6 The five varieties of thought patterns to witness are: 1) knowing correctly
(pramana), 2) incorrect knowing (viparyaya), 3) fantasy or imagination (vikalpa), 4)
the object of void-ness that is deep sleep (nidra), and 5) recollection or memory
(smriti).
(pramana viparyaya vikalpa nidra smritayah)
• pramana = real or valid cognition, right knowledge, valid proof, seeing clearly
• viparyayah = unreal cognition, indiscrimination, perverse cognition, wrong
knowledge, misconception, incorrect knowing, not seeing clearly
• vikalpah = imagination, verbal misconception or delusion, fantasy,
hallucination
• nidra = deep sleep • smritayah = memory, remembering
1.7 Of these five, there are three ways of gaining correct knowledge (pramana): 1)
perception, 2) inference, and 3) testimony or verbal communication from others who
have knowledge.
(pratyaksha anumana agamah pramanani)
• pratyaksha = direct perception or cognition

Practice and non-attachment (1.12-1.16)
1.12 These thought patterns (vrittis) are mastered (nirodhah, regulated, coordinated,
controlled, stilled, quieted) through practice (abhyasa) and non-attachment
(vairagya).
(abhyasa vairagyabhyam tat nirodhah)

1.15 When the mind loses desire even for objects seen or described in a tradition or in
scriptures, it acquires a state of utter (vashikara) desirelessness that is called nonattachment (vairagya).

Types of concentration (1.17-1.18)
1.17 The deep absorption of attention on an object is of four kinds, 1) gross (vitarka),
2) subtle (vichara), 3) bliss accompanied (ananda), and 4) with I-ness (asmita), and
is called samprajnata samadhi.

Page 9 of 63
04
1.18 The other kind of samadhi is asamprajnata samadhi, and has no object in which
attention is absorbed, wherein only latent impressions remain; attainment of this state
is preceded by the constant practice of allowing all of the gross and subtle fluctuations
of mind to recede back into the field from which they arose.

Efforts and commitment (1.19-1.22)
1.19 Some who have attained higher levels (videhas) or know unmanifest nature
(prakritilayas), are drawn into birth in this world by their remaining latent impressions
of ignorance, and more naturally come to these states of samadhi.
(bhava pratyayah videha prakriti layanam)
• bhava = objective existence, becoming
• pratyayah = cause, cognitive principle, content of mind, cognition
• videha = bodiless, disembodied
• prakriti = creative cause, subtlest material cause, nature • layanam = dissolved, merged into
1.20 Others follow a five-fold systematic path of 1) faithful certainty in the path, 2)
directing energy towards the practices, 3) repeated memory of the path and the
process of stilling the mind, 4) training in deep concentration, and 5) the pursuit of
real knowledge, by which the higher samadhi (asamprajnata samadhi) is attained.

• tivra = rate is fast, speedy
• samvega = momentum, force, vigor, conviction, enthusiasm • asannah = very close, near, speedy

1.30 Nine kinds of distractions come that are obstacles naturally encountered on the
path, and are physical illness, tendency of the mind to not work efficiently, doubt or
indecision, lack of attention to pursuing the means of samadhi, laziness in mind and
body, failure to regulate the desire for worldly objects, incorrect assumptions or
thinking, failing to attain stages of the practice, and instability in maintaining a level of

1.41 When the modifications of mind have become weakened, the mind becomes like
a transparent crystal, and thus can easily take on the qualities of whatever object
observed, whether that object be the observer, the means of observing, or an object
observed, in a process of engrossment called samapattih.

• svarupa-shunya = devoid of its own nature (shunya = devoid; svarupa = its
own nature)
• iva = as it were
• artha-matra = only the object (artha = object; matra = only)
• nirbhasa = illuminative, shining brightly
• nirvitarka = without a gross thought (nir = without; vitarka = gross thought)
1.44 In the same way that these engrossments operate with gross objects in savitarka
samapattih, the engrossment with subtle objects also operates, and is known as
savichara and nirvichara samapattih.
(etaya eva savichara nirvichara cha sukshma-vishaya vyakhyata)
• etaya = by this
• eva = also
• savichara = accompanied by subtle thoughts (sa = with; vichara = subtle
thoughts)
• nirvichara = devoid of subtle thoughts (nir = without; vichara = subtle
thoughts)
• cha = and
• sukshma-vishaya = having subtle for their objects (sukshma = subtle; vishaya
= objects)
• vyakhyata = are explained, described, defined

1.45 Having such subtle objects extends all the way up to unmanifest prakriti.
(sukshma vishayatvam cha alinga paryavasanam)
• sukshma = subtle
• vishayatvam = of having as objects
• cha = and
• alinga = without a mark or trace, unmanifest prakriti (subtlest matter) • paryavasanam = extending up to, ending at
1.46 These four varieties of engrossment are the only kinds of concentrations
(samadhi) which are objective, and have a seed of an object.
(tah eva sabijah samadhih)
• tah = these, those, they
• eva = only
• sabijah = with seed, seeded
• samadhih = deep absorption of meditation, entasy
1.47 As one gains proficiency in the undisturbed flow in nirvichara, a purity and
luminosity of the inner instrument of mind is developed.
(nirvichara vaisharadye adhyatma prasadah)
• nirvichara = devoid of subtle thoughts (nir = without; vichara = subtle
thoughts)
• vaisharadye = with undisturbed flow,
• adhyatma = spiritual, regarding the atman or true Self • prasadah = purity, luminosity, illumination, clearness
1.48 The experiential knowledge that is gained in that state is one of essential wisdom
and is filled with truth.
(ritambhara tatra prajna)
• ritambhara = filled with higher truth, essence, supreme cognition
• tatra = there • prajna = knowledge, wisdom, insight
1.49 That knowledge is different from the knowledge that is commingled with
testimony or through inference, because it relates directly to the specifics of the
object, rather than to those words or other concepts.
(shruta anumana prajnabhyam anya-vishaya vishesha-arthatvat)
• shruta = testimony, heard, learned, from tradition
• anumana = inference, reasoning, deduction
• prajnabhyam = from those kinds of knowledge
• anya-vishaya = having different objects (anya = different; vishaya = objects,
fields, realms, domains)
• vishesha-arthatvat = relating to particular objects, purpose, or significance
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati
Page 18 of 63

1.50 This type of knowledge that is filled with truth creates latent impressions in the
mind-field, and those new impressions tend to reduce the formation of other less
useful forms of habitual latent impressions.
(tajjah samskarah anya samskara paribandhi)
• tajjah = arising or producing from that
• samskarah = deep impressions, residual imprints, activating imprints
• anya = of other
• samskara = deep impressions, residual imprints, activating imprints
• paribandhi = impeding, obstructing, reducing, opposing, inhibiting
1.51 When even these latent impressions from truth filled knowledge recede along
with the other impressions, then there is objectless concentration.
(tasya api nirodhe sarva nirodhat nirbijah samadhih)
• tasya = of that
• api = too
• nirodhe = receding, mastery, coordination, control, regulation, setting aside of
• sarva = of all
• nirodhat = through nirodhah (nirodhah = control, regulation, channeling,
mastery, integration, coordination, understanding, stilling, quieting, setting
aside of)
• nirbijah = without a seed, seedless (nir = without; bijah = seed)
• samadhih = deep absorption of meditation, entasy

Chapter 2: Practices (Sadhana Pada)
Minimizing gross colorings that veil the Self (2.1-2.9)
2.1 Yoga in the form of action (kriya yoga) has three parts: 1) training and purifying
the senses (tapas), 2) self-study in the context of teachings (svadhyaya), and 3)
devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (ishvara
pranidhana).
(tapah svadhyaya ishvara-pranidhana kriya-yogah)
• tapah = accepting the purifying aspects of painful experience, purifying action,
training the senses
• svadhyaya = self-study in the context of teachings, remembrance of sacred
word or mantra
• ishvara = creative source, causal field, God, supreme Guru or teacher
• pranidhana = practicing the presence, dedication, devotion, surrender of fruits
of practice
• kriya-yogah = yoga of practice, action, practical yoga
2.2 That Yoga of action (kriya yoga) is practiced to bring about samadhi and to
minimize the colored thought patterns (kleshas).
(samadhi bhavana arthah klesha tanu karanarthah cha)
• samadhi = deep absorption of meditation, the state of perfected concentration
• bhavana = to bring about, cultivate
• arthah = for the purpose of
• klesha = colored, painful, afflicted, impure
• tanu-karana = minimize, to make fine, attenuate, weaken
• arthah = for the purpose
• cha = and
2.3 There are five kinds of coloring (kleshas): 1) forgetting, or ignorance about the
true nature of things (avidya), 2) I-ness, individuality, or egoism (asmita), 3)
attachment or addiction to mental impressions or objects (raga), 4) aversion to
thought patterns or objects (dvesha), and 5) love of these as being life itself, as well
as fear of their loss as being death.
(avidya asmita raga dvesha abhinivesha pancha klesha)
• avidya = spiritual forgetting, ignorance, veiling, nescience
• asmita = associated with I-ness
• raga = attraction or drawing to, addiction
• dvesha = aversion or pushing away, hatred
• abhinivesha = resistance to loss, fear of death of identity, desire for continuity,
clinging to the life of
• pancha = five
• klesha = colored, painful, afflicted, impure; the root klish means to cause
trouble; (klesha is the noun form of the adjective klishta)
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati
Page 20 of 63
04
2.4 The root forgetting or ignorance of the nature of things (avidya) is the breeding
ground for the other of the five colorings (kleshas), and each of these is in one of four
states: 1) dormant or inactive, 2) attenuated or weakened, 3) interrupted or
separated from temporarily, or 4) active and producing thoughts or actions to varying
degrees.
(avidya kshetram uttaresham prasupta tanu vicchinna udaranam)
• avidya = spiritual forgetting, ignorance, veiling, nescience
• kshetram = field, breeding ground
• uttaresham = for the others
• prasupta = dormant, latent, seed
• tanu = attenuated, weakened
• vicchinna = distanced, separated, cut off, intercepted, alternated
• udaranam = fully active, aroused, sustained
2.5 Ignorance (avidya) is of four types: 1) regarding that which is transient as eternal,
2) mistaking the impure for pure, 3) thinking that which brings misery to bring
happiness, and 4) taking that which is not-self to be self.
(antiya ashuchi duhkha anatmasu nitya shuchi sukha atman khyatih avidya)
• antiya = non-eternal, impermanent, ephemeral
• ashuchi = impure
• duhkha = painful, sorrowful, suffering
• anatmasu = non-self, non-atman
• nitya = eternal, everlasting
• shuchi = pure
• sukha = pleasurable, pleasant
• atman = Self, soul
• khyatih = taking to be, supposing to be, seeing as if
• avidya = spiritual forgetting, ignorance, veiling, nescience
2.6 The coloring (klesha) of I-ness or egoism (asmita), which arises from the
ignorance, occurs due to the mistake of taking the intellect (buddhi, which knows,
decides, judges, and discriminates) to itself be pure consciousness (purusha/drig).
(drig darshana shaktyoh ekatmata iva asmita)
• drig = consciousness itself as seeing agent
• darshana-shaktyoh = the instrument of seeing, power of intellect or buddhi to
observe (darshana = seeing; shakti = power)
• ekatmata = identity, with oneself (eka = one; atmata = selfness
• iva = appearing to be, apparently as if
• asmita = I-ness
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati

2.7 Attachment (raga) is a separate modification of mind, which follows the rising of
the memory of pleasure, where the three modifications of attachment, pleasure, and
the memory of the object are then associated with one another.
(sukha anushayi ragah)
• sukha = pleasure
• anushayi = sequential attraction to, closely following, secondary
accompaniment, resting on
• ragah = attachment, addiction
2.8 Aversion (dvesha) is a modification that results from misery associated with some
memory, whereby the three modifications of aversion, pain, and the memory of the
object or experience are then associated with one another.
(dukha anushayi dvesha)
• dukha = pain, sorrow, suffering
• anushayi = sequential attraction to, closely following, secondary
accompaniment, resting on
• dvesha = aversion or pushing away, hatred
2.9 Even for those people who are learned, there is an ever-flowing, firmly established
love for continuation and a fear of cessation, or death, of these various colored
modifications (kleshas).
(sva-rasa-vahi vidushah api tatha rudhah abhiniveshah)
• sva-rasa-vahi = flowing on its own momentum (sva = own; rasa = inclination,
momentum, potency; vahi = flowing)
• vidushah = in the wise or learned person
• api = even
• tatha = the same way
• rudhah = firmly established
• abhiniveshah = resistance to loss, fear of death of identity, desire for
continuity, clinging to the life of
Dealing with subtle impressions that veil the Self (2.10-2.11)
2.10 When the five types of colorings (kleshas) are in their subtle, merely potential
form, they are then destroyed by their disappearance or cessation into and of the field
of mind itself.
(te pratipasava heyah sukshmah)
• te = these
• pratipasava = involution, resolving back into the cause from which they arose
• heyah = to be overcome, reduced, abandoned, destroyed, eliminated
• sukshmah = subtle
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati
Page 22 of 63
04
2.11 When the modifications still have some potency of coloring (klishta), they are
brought to the state of mere potential by meditation (dhyana).
(dhyana heyah tat vrittayah)
• dhyana = meditation
• heyah = to be overcome, reduced, abandoned, destroyed
• tat = that
• vrittayah = operations, activities, fluctuations, modifications, changes, or
various forms of the mind-field
Breaking the alliance of karma (2.12-2.25)
2.12 Latent impressions that are colored (karmashaya) result from other actions
(karmas) that were brought about by colorings (kleshas), and become active and
experienced in a current life or a future life.
(klesha-mula karma-ashaya drishta adrishta janma vedaniyah)
• klesha-mula = having colorings as its origin (klesha = colored, painful,
afflicted, impure; mula = origin, root)
• karma-ashaya = repository of karma (karma = actions stemming from the
deep impressions of samskaras; ashaya = repository, accumulation, deposit,
vehicle, reservoir, womb)
• drishta = seen, visible, experienced consciously, present
• adrishta = unseen, invisible, only experienced unconsciously, future
• janma = in births • vedaniyah = to be experienced
2.13 As long as those colorings (kleshas) remains at the root, three consequences are
produced: 1) birth, 2) span of life, and 3) experiences in that life.
(sati mule tat vipakah jati ayus bhogah)
• sati = since being here, being present, existing
• mule = to be at the root
• tat = of that
• vipakah = ripening, fruition, maturation
• jati = type of birth, species, state of life
• ayus = span of life, lifetime
• bhogah = having experience, resulting enjoyment
2.14 Because of having the nature of merits or demerits (virtue or vice), these three
(birth, span of life, and experiences) may be experienced as either pleasure or pain.
(te hlada-paritapa-phalah punya apunya hetutvat)
• te = they, those (referring to those who take birth, as in the last sutra)
• hlada-paritapa-phalah = experiencing pleasure and pain as fruits (hlada =
pleasure, delight; paritapa = pain, agony, anguish; phalah = fruits)
• punya = virtuous, meritorious, benevolent
• apunya = non-virtuous, vice, bad, wicked, evil, bad, demerit, non-meritorious
• hetutvat = having as their cause (the punya or apunya)

2.15 A wise, discriminating person sees all worldly experiences as painful, because of
reasoning that all these experiences lead to more consequences, anxiety, and deep
habits (samskaras), as well as acting in opposition to the natural qualities.
(parinama tapa samskara duhkhaih guna vrittih virodhat cha duhkham eva sarvam
vivekinah)

2.16 Because the worldly experiences are seen as painful, it is the pain, which is yet
to come that is to be avoided and discarded.
(heyam duhkham anagatam)
• heyam = to be discarded, avoided, prevented
• duhkham = pain, suffering, sorrow
• anagatam = which has not yet come, in the future
2.17 The uniting of the seer (the subject, or experiencer) with the seen (the object, or
that which is experienced) is the cause or connection to be avoided.
(drashtri drishyayoh samyogah heya hetuh)
• drashtri = of the seer, knower, apprehender
• drishyayoh = of the seen, knowable
• samyogah = union, conjunction
• heya = to be discarded, avoided, prevented

2.18 The objects (or knowables) are by their nature of: 1) illumination or sentience, 2)
activity or mutability, or 3) inertia or stasis; they consist of the elements and the
powers of the senses, and exist for the purpose of experiencing the world and for
liberation or enlightenment.
(prakasha kriya sthiti shilam bhuta indriya atmakam bhoga apavarga artham
drishyam)

2.19 There are four states of the elements (gunas), and these are: 1) diversified,
specialized, or particularized (vishesha), 2) undiversified, unspecialized, or
unparticularized (avishesha), 3) indicator-only, undifferentiated phenomenal, or
marked only (linga-matra), and 4) without indicator, noumenal, or without mark
(alingani).
(vishesha avishesha linga-matra alingani guna parvani)
• vishesha = diversified, specialized, particularized, having differences
• avishesha = undiversified, unspecialized, unparticularized, having no
differences
• linga-matra = undifferentiated, only a mark or trace (linga = mark, trace;

• alingani = without even a mark or trace, undifferentiated subtle matter
• guna-parvani = state of the gunas (guna = of the qualities, gunas of prakriti;
parvani = state, stage, level)
2.20 The Seer is but the force of seeing itself, appearing to see or experience that
which is presented as a cognitive principle.
(drashta drishi matrah suddhah api pratyaya anupashyah)

2.21 The essence or nature of the knowable objects exists only to serve as the
objective field for pure consciousness.
(tad-artha eva drishyasya atma)
• tad-artha = the purpose for that, to serve as (tad = that; artha = purpose)
• eva = only
• drishyasya = of the seen, knowable • atma = essence, being, existence
2.22 Although knowable objects cease to exist in relation to one who has experienced
their fundamental, formless true nature, the appearance of the knowable objects is
not destroyed, for their existence continues to be shared by others who are still
observing them in their grosser forms.
(krita-artham prati nashtam api anashtam tat anya sadharanatvat)
• krita-artham = one whose purpose has been accomplished (krita =
accomplished; artham = purpose)

• anashtam = has not ceased, not dissolved, not finished, not destroyed
• tat = that
• anya = for others

2.23 Having an alliance, or relationship between objects and the Self is the necessary
means by which there can subsequently be realization of the true nature of those
objects by that very Self.
(sva svami saktyoh svarupa upalabdhi hetuh samyogah)
• sva = of being owned
• svami = of being owner, master, the one who possesses

2.24 Avidya or ignorance (2.3-2.5), the condition of ignoring, is the underlying cause
that allows this alliance to appear to exist.
(tasya hetuh avidya)
• tasya = of that (of that alliance, from last sutra)
• hetuh = that brings about, the cause, reason
• avidya = spiritual forgetting, ignorance, veiling, nescience
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati
Page 26 of 63
04
2.25 By causing a lack of avidya, or ignorance there is then an absence of the alliance,
and this leads to a freedom known as a state of liberation or enlightenment for the
Seer.
(tat abhavat samyogah abhavah hanam tat drishi kaivalyam)

2.28 Through the practice of the different limbs, or steps to Yoga, whereby impurities
are eliminated, there arises an illumination that culminates in discriminative wisdom,
or enlightenment.
(yoga anga anusthanad ashuddhi kshaye jnana diptih a viveka khyateh)

2.29 The eight rungs, limbs, or steps of Yoga are the codes of self-regulation or
restraint (yamas), observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), postures
(asana), expansion of breath and prana (pranayama), withdrawal of the senses
(pratyahara), concentration (dharana), meditation (dhyana), and perfected

Yamas and Niyamas, rungs #1 and #2 (2.30-2.34)
2.30 Non-injury or non-harming (ahimsa), truthfulness (satya), abstention from
stealing (asteya), walking in awareness of the highest reality (brahmacharya), and
non-possessiveness or non-grasping with the senses (aparigraha) are the five yamas,
or codes of self-regulation or restraint, and are the first of the eight steps of Yoga.

2.32 Cleanliness and purity of body and mind (shaucha), an attitude of contentment
(santosha), ascesis or training of the senses (tapas), self-study and reflection on
sacred words (svadhyaya), and an attitude of letting go into one's source
(ishvarapranidhana) are the observances or practices of self-training (niyamas), and
are the second rung on the ladder of Yoga.

unwholesome, troublesome, or deviant thoughts, principles in the opposite direction,
or contrary thought should be cultivated.

may be preceded by, or performed through anger, greed or delusion, and can be mild,
moderate or intense in nature. To remind oneself that these negative thoughts and
actions are the causes of unending misery and ignorance is the contrary thought, or
principle in the opposite direction that was recommended in the previous sutra.

Pranayama and breath control, rung #4 of 8 (2.49-2.53)
2.49 Once that perfected posture has been achieved, the slowing or braking of the
force behind, and of unregulated movement of inhalation and exhalation is called
breath control and expansion of prana (pranayama), which leads to the absence of the
awareness of both, and is the fourth of the eight rungs.

2.50 That pranayama has three aspects of external or outward flow (exhalation),
internal or inward flow (inhalation), and the third, which is the absence of both during
the transition between them, and is known as fixedness, retention, or suspension.
These are regulated by place, time, and number, with breath becoming slow and
subtle.

• bahya = external
• abhyantara = internal
• vishaya = region, spheres, realms, fields

2.53 Through these practices and processes of pranayama, which is the fourth of the
eight steps, the mind acquires or develops the fitness, qualification, or capability for
true concentration (dharana), which is itself the sixth of the steps.

• dharanasu = for concentration, for dharana
• cha = and
• yogyata = fitness, preparedness, qualification, capability • manasah = mind
Pratyahara or sense withdrawal, rung #5 of 8 (2.54-2.55)
2.54 When the mental organs of senses and actions (indriyas) cease to be engaged
with the corresponding objects in their mental realm, and assimilate or turn back into
the mind-field from which they arose, this is called pratyahara, and is the fifth step.

2.55 Through that turning inward of the organs of senses and actions (indriyas) also
comes a supreme ability, controllability, or mastery over those senses inclining to go
outward towards their objects.

Chapter 3: Progressing (Vibhuti Pada)
Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, rungs #6, #7, and #8 (3.1-3.3)
3.1 Concentration (dharana) is the process of holding or fixing the attention of mind
onto one object or place, and is the sixth of the eight rungs.

• deshah = place, object, point, spot
• bandhah = binding to, holding, fixing, uniting
• chittasya = of the mind, consciousness • dharana = concentration, focusing, directing attention

(tatra pratyaya ekatanata dhyanam)
• tatra = there, therein (in that place or desha of 3.1)
• pratyaya = the cause, the feeling, causal or cognitive principle, notion, content
of mind, presented idea, cognition

Samyama is the finer tool (3.4-3.6)
3.4 The three processes of dharana, dhyana, and samadhi, when taken together on
the same object, place or point is called samyama.
(trayam ekatra samyama)
• trayam = the three
• ekatra = together, as one
• samyama = dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation), and samadhi taken
together
3.5 Through the mastery of that three-part process of samyama, the light of

flashes, or is visible.
(tad jayat prajna lokah)
• tad = of that
• jayat = achievement, mastery

• tasya = its, of that
• bhumisu = to the planes, states, stages
• viniyogah = application, practice
Internal is seen to be external (3.7-3.8)

samadhi are more intimate or internal than the previous five practices.
(trayam antar angam purvebhyah)

3.8 However, these three practices are external, and not intimate compared to nirbija
samadhi, which is samadhi that has no object, nor even a seed object on which there
is concentration.
(tad api bahir angam nirbijasya)
• tad = these, they
• api = even, also, compared to

Witnessing subtle transitions with Samyama (3.9-3.16)
3.9 That high level of mastery called nirodhah-parinamah occurs in the moment of
transition when there is a convergence of the rising tendency of deep impressions, the
subsiding tendency, and the attention of the mind field itself.
(vyutthana nirodhah samskara abhibhava pradurbhavau nirodhah ksana chitta

transformation, of change, result, consequence, mutative effect, alteration)
(2.15)
3.10 The steady flow of this state (nirodhah-parinamah) continues by the creation of
deep impressions (samskaras) from doing the practice.
(tasya prashanta vahita samskarat)
• tasya = its (referring to the mind in the state of nirodhah-parinamah, in the
last sutra)

3.11 The mastery called samadhi-parinamah is the transition whereby the tendency to
all-pointedness subsides, while the tendency to one-pointedness arises.

higher state, deep absorption of meditation, the state of perfected
concentration; parinamah = transition, transformation, of change, result,

consequence, mutative effect, alteration)
3.13 These three transition processes also explain the three transformations of form,
time, and characteristics, and how these relate to the material elements and senses.
(etena bhuta indriyasau dharma laksana avastha parinamah vyakhyatah)
• etena = by this, by these
• bhuta = elements

Experiences from Samyama (3.17-3.37)
3.17 The name associated with an object, the object itself implied by that name, and
the conceptual existence of the object, all three usually interpenetrate or commingle
with one another. By samyama on the distinction between these three, the meaning of

3.36 The having of experiences comes from a presented idea only when there is a
commingling of the subtlest aspect of mind (sattva) and pure consciousness
(purusha), which are really quite different. Samyama on the pure consciousness,
which is distinct from the subtlest aspect of mind, reveals knowledge of that pure
consciousness.
(sattva purusayoh atyanta asankirnayoh pratyaya avishesah bhogah pararthatvat

Renunciation that brings kaivalya or liberation (3.50-3.52)
3.50 To one well established in the knowledge of the distinction between the purest
aspect of mind and consciousness itself, there comes supremacy over all forms or
states of existence, as well as over all forms of knowing.
(sattva purusha anyata khyati matrasya sarva-bhava adhisthatrittvam sarvajnatritvam cha)
[Note: In some renditions this is sutra 3.48 or 3.49]

3.52 When invited by the celestial beings, no cause should be allowed to arise in the
mind that would allow either acceptance of the offer, or the smile of pride from
receiving the invitation, because to allow such thoughts to arise again might create
the possibility of repeating undesirable thoughts and actions.

Chapter 4: Liberation (Kaivalya Pada)
Means of attaining experience (4.1-4.3)
4.1 The subtler attainments come with birth or are attained through herbs, mantra,
austerities or concentration.
(janma osadhi mantra tapah samadhi jah siddhyayah)
• janma = birth
• ausadhi = herbs
• mantra = sound vibrations, incantations, divine word
• tapah = training the senses, austerities
• samadhi = deep concentration or entasy

through the filling in of their innate nature.
(jatyantara parinamah prakriti apurat)
• jatyantara = to another type of birth
• parinamah = transition or transformation
• prakriti = creative cause, subtlest material cause
• apurat = by the inflow or filling in process
4.3 Incidental causes or actions do not lead to the emergence of attainments or
realization, but rather, come by the removal of obstacles, much like the way a farmer
removes a barrier (sluice gate), so as to naturally allow the irrigation of his field.
(nimittam aprayojakam prakritinam varana bhedas tu tatah ksetrikavat
• nimittam = incidental cause or instrument

Emergence and mastery of mind (4.4-4.6)
4.4 The emergent mind fields springs forth from the individuality of I-ness (asmita).
(nirmana chittani asmita matrat)
• nirmana = produced, created, constructed, forming, arising, emerging
• chitta = minds, fields of consciousness
• asmita = I-ness
• matra = alone, individuality
4.5 While the activities of the emergent mind fields may be diverse, the one mind is
the director of the many.
(pravritti bhede prayojakam chittam ekam anekesam)
• pravritti = activity,
• bhede = difference, distinction, diverse
• prayojakam = causing, directing
• chitta = mind field

4.6 Of these mind fields, the one that is born from meditation is free from any latent
impressions that could produce karma.
(tatra dhyana jam anasayam)
• tatra = of these
• dhyana = meditation
• jam = born
• anasayam = without stored impressions, free from karmic vehicles, without
deposit of past influences, without latency

others.
(karma ashukla akrisnam yoginah trividham itaresam)
• karma = actions stemming from the deep impressions of samskaras
• ashukla = not white
• akrisnam = nor black
• yoginah = of a yogi
• trividham = threefold
• itaresam = of the others

4.8 Those threefold actions result in latent impressions (vasanas) that will later arise
to fruition only corresponding to those impressions.
(tatah tad vipaka anugunanam eva abhivyaktih vasananam)
• tatah = from that, thence
• tad = that, their
• vipaka = fruition
• anugunanam = following, corresponding to, accordingly
• eva = only
• abhivyaktih = manifest
• vasananam = latent potencies, potentials, subliminal imprints
Subconscious impressions (4.9-4.12)
4.9 Since memory (smriti) and the deep habit patterns (samskaras) are the same in
appearance, there is an unbroken continuity in the playing out of those traits, even
though there might be a gap in location, time, or state of life.
(jati desha kala vyavahitanam api anantaryam smriti samskarayoh eka rupatvat)
• jati = type of existence, state of life, category of incarnation
• desha = of locality, space, place
• kala = of time, moment, point

• api = even, although
• anantaryam = uninterrupted sequence
• smriti = of memory
• samskarayoh = deep impressions, imprints in the unconscious, deepest habits,
subliminal activators, traces
• eka-rupatvat = because of their sameness, similarity (eka = one; rupatvat =
formless)
4.10 There is no beginning to the process of these deep habit patterns (samskaras),
due to the eternal nature of the will to live.
(tasam anaditvam cha ashisah nityatvat)
• tasam = for these
• anaditvam = no beginning
• cha = and
• ashisah = will to live, desire for life • nityatvat = eternal, permanent, perpetual
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati
Page 57 of 63

4.11 Since the impressions (4.10) are held together by cause, motive, substratum,
and object, they disappear when those deep impressions disappear.
(hetu phala ashraya alambana samgrihitatvat esam abhave tad abhavah)
• hetu = cause

• ashraya = substratum
• alambana = object resting upon
• samgrihitatvat = held together
• esam = of these
• abhave = on the disappearance of

4.12 Past and future exist in the present reality, appearing to be different because of
having different characteristics or forms.

• atita = past
• anagatam = future
• svarupatah = in reality, in its own form
• asti = exist
• adhva = of the paths, conditions
• bhedat = being a difference • dharmanam = characteristics, forms
Objects and the 3 gunas (4.13-4.14)
4.13 Whether these ever-present characteristics or forms are manifest or subtle, they
are composed of the primary elements called the three gunas.
(te vyakta suksmah guna atmanah)
• te = they, these
• vyakta = manifest
• suksmah = subtle
• guna = elements, prime qualities, constituents, attributes; (three gunas of

4.14 The characteristics of an object appear as a single unit, as they manifested
uniformly from the underlying elements.

• parinama = of change, transformation, result, consequence, mutative effect,
alteration
• ekatvat = due to oneness, uniformity, sameness, coordinated
• vastu = a reality, real object, existent
• tattvam = essence, reality, that-ness

Page 58 of 63

Mind perceiving objects (4.15-4.17)
4.15 Although the same objects may be perceived by different minds, they are
perceived in different ways, because those minds manifested differently.
(vastu samye chitta bhedat tayoh vibhaktah panthah)
• vastu = a reality, real object, existent
• samye = sameness
• chitta = minds, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• bhedat = diversity, difference
• tayoh = their, of the two
• vibhaktah = separation, division • panthah = paths, levels of being, ways of perceiving
4.16 However, the object itself does not depend on any one mind, for if it did, then
what would happen to the object if it were not being experienced by that mind?
(na cha eka chitta tantram ched vastu tat pramanakam tada kim syat)
• na = not
• cha = and
• eka = one, single
• chitta = mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• tantram = dependent
• ched = if
• vastu = a reality, real object, existent

• apramanakam = not cognized
• tada = then
• kim = what
• syat = exists, becomes
4.17 Objects are either known or not known according to the way in which the
coloring of that object falls on the coloring of the mind observing it.
(tad uparaga apeksitvat chittasya vastu jnata ajnatam)
• tad = that, these, thereby
• uparaga = coloring, conditioning, reflection
• apeksitvat = due to need

Illumination of the mind (4.18-4.21)
4.18 The activities of the mind are always known by the pure consciousness, because
that pure consciousness is superior to, support of, and master over the mind.
(sada jnatah chitta vrittayah tat prabhu purusasya aparinamitvat)
• sada = always
• jnatah = are known
• chitta = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field

various forms of the mind-field
• tat = their, that
• prabhu = master, superior, support of
• purusasya = pure consciousness
• aparinamitvat = changelessness, immutable
4.19 That mind is not self-illuminating, as it is the object of knowledge and perception
by the pure consciousness.
(na tat svabhasam drishyatvat)
• na = is not
• tat = it
• svabhasam = self illuminating (sva = own; abhasa = illumination)
• drishyatvat = knowability
4.20 Nor can both the mind and the illuminating process be cognized simultaneously.

• eka-samaye = at the same time, simultaneously (eka = one; samaye = time,
condition)
• cha = and, nor
• ubhaye = both • anavadharanam = cannot be cognized
4.21 If one mind were illumined by another, as its master, then there would be an
endless and absurd progression of cognitions, as well as confusion.
(chitta antara drishye buddhi-buddheh atiprasangah smriti sankarah cha)
• chitta = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• antara = another
• drishye = seen, perceived
• buddhi-buddheh = knower of knowledge, perceiver of perception

Buddhi, discrimination, and liberation (4.22-4.26)
4.22 When the unchanging consciousness appears to take on the shape of that finest
aspect of mind-field (4.18), then the experience of one's own cognition process is
possible.
(chitteh apratisamkramayah tad akara apattau sva buddhi samvedanam)
• chitteh = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• apratisamkramayah = unchanging, not moving
• tad = that
• akara = form
• apattau = assumed, transformed into, reflection

4.23 Therefore, the mind field, which is colored by both seer and seen, has the
potential to perceive any and all objects.
(drastri drisya uparaktam chittam sarva artham)
• drastri = seer
• drisya = seen
• uparaktam = colored
• chittam = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• sarva = any, all
• artham = objects
4.24 That mind field, though filled with countless impressions, exists for the benefit of
another witnessing consciousness, as the mind field is operating only in combination
with those impressions.
(tad asankheya vasanabhih chittam api parartham samhatya karitvat)
• tad = that
• asankheya = countless
• vasanabhih = latent potencies, potentials, subliminal imprints, impressions
• chittam = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
• api = though, also
• parartham = for another
• samhatya = in combination with
• karitvat = action

4.25 For one who has experienced this distinction between seer and this subtlest
mind, the false identities and even the curiosity about the nature of one's own self
come to an end.
(vishesa darshinah atma bhava bhavana vinivrittih)
• vishesa = distinction
• darshinah = of one who sees
• atma = Self
• bhava = in the nature of, in relation to
• bhavana = projection, feeling, reflection
• vinivrittih = complete cessation
4.26 Then the mind is inclined towards the highest discrimination, and gravitates
towards absolute liberation between seer and seen.
(tada viveka nimnam kaivalya pragbharam chittam)
• tada = then
• viveka = discrimination, discernment
• nimnam = incline towards
• kaivalya = liberation, independence from
• pragbharam = gravitate towards
• chittam = of the mind, of the consciousness of the mind-field
Breaches in enlightenment (4.27-4.28)
4.27 When there are breaks or breaches in that high discrimination, other impressions
arise from the deep unconscious.
(tachchhidresu pratyaya antarani samskarebhyah)
• tachchhidresu = in the intervals, breaks, gaps, between
• pratyaya = the cause, the feeling, causal or cognitive principle, notion, content
of mind, presented idea, cognition
• antarani = other
• samskarebhyah = deep impressions, imprints in the unconscious, deepest
habits, subliminal activators, traces
4.28 The removal of those interfering thought patterns is by the same means by which
the original colorings were removed.
(hanam esam kleshavat uktam)
• hanam = removal
• esam = their
• kleshavat = like the previous colorings
• uktam = as has been described

Perpetual enlightenment (4.29-4.30)
4.29 When there is no longer any interest even in omniscience, that discrimination
allows the samadhi, which brings an abundance of virtues like a rain cloud brings rain.
(prasankhyane api akusidasya sarvatha viveka khyateh dharma-meghah samadhih)
• prasankhyane = highest knowledge, omniscience
• api = even
• akusidasya = having no interest remaining
• sarvatha = constant, in every way, always
• viveka-khyateh = discriminative knowledge (viveka = discriminative,
discernment; khyateh = knowledge, correct cognition, clarity, awareness)
• dharma-meghah= rain cloud of virtues (dharma = form, quality, virtues;
meghah = cloud) • samadhih = deep absorption of meditation, entasy
4.30 After that dharma-meghah samadhi, the colorings of the kleshas and the karmas
are removed.
(tatah klesha karma nivrittih)
• tatah = thereafter
• klesha = colored, painful, afflicted, impure
• karma = actions stemming from the deep impressions of samskaras
• nivrittih = cease, discontinue, remove
Knowables become few (4.31)
4.31 Then, by the removal of those veils of imperfection, there comes the experience
of the infinite, and the realization that there is almost nothing to be known.
(tada sarva avarana mala apetasya jnanasya anantyat jneyam alpam)
• tada = then
• sarva = all
• avarana = veils, coverings
• mala = imperfections
• apetasya = removed
• jnanasya = knowledge
• anantyat = infinite
• jneyam = to be known • alpam = little, almost nothing

Gunas and liberation or Kaivalya (4.32-4.34)
4.32 Also resulting from that dharma-meghah samadhi (4.29), the three primary
elements or gunas (4.13-4.14) will have fulfilled their purpose, cease to transform into
further transformations, and recede back into their essence.
(tatah kritarthanam parinama krama samaptih gunanam)
• tatah = then, by that
• krita = fulfilled
• arthanam = purpose
• parinama = transition, transformation, of change, result, consequence,
mutative effect, alteration (2.15, 3.9-3.16)
• krama = sequence, succession, order (3.15)
• samaptih = terminate, end
• gunanam = elements, prime qualities, constituents, attributes; (three gunas of
sattvas, rajas, tamas)
4.33 The sequencing process of moments and impressions corresponds to the
moments of time, and is apprehended at the end point of the sequence.
(ksana pratiyogi parinama aparanta nigrahyah kramah)
• ksana = moments
• pratiyogi = uninterrupted succession
• parinama = transition, transformation, of change, result, consequence,
mutative effect, alteration
• aparanta = end point, at the end
• nigrahyah = recognizable, apprehensible, comprehensible
• kramah = succession, process, course, order, series
4.34 When those primary elements involve, or resolve themselves back into that out
of which they emerged, there comes liberation, wherein the power of pure
consciousness becomes established in its true nature.
(purusha artha sunyanam gunanam pratiprasavah kaivalyam svarupa pratistha va
chiti shaktih iti)
• purusha = pure consciousness, Self
• artha = purpose, meaning
• sunyanam = devoid
• gunanam = elements, prime qualities, constituents, attributes; (three gunas of
sattvas, rajas, tamas)
• pratiprasavah = involution, resolve, recede
• kaivalyam = absolute freedom, liberation, enlightenment (2.25)
• svarupa = own form
• pratistha = established
• va = or
• chiti = consciousness
• shaktih = power
• iti = the end, finis (to denote the end of the teachings)
