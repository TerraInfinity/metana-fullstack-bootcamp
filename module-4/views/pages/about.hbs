        About Us Page Template
        ----------------------
        This template defines the structure and content for the "About Us" page.
        
        In Relation to the Assignment:
          - The assignment requires you to build an Express application using Handlebars.
          - Each page (like the About Us page) is handled by its own template.
          - This file demonstrates how to separate page-specific content from the common layout.
          - Here, dynamic data (e.g. the current year) is injected from the server via Express.
        
        Key Best Practices Illustrated:
          - **Separation of Concerns**: The layout (common HTML structure) is defined in main.hbs,
            while about.hbs contains only the page-specific content.
          - **Dynamic Data Rendering**: The {{currentYear}} placeholder gets its value from the server,
            showing how to pass data into your templates effectively.
          - **Reusability**: Shared elements such as the header and footer are defined in partials and included
            only once in the main layout file, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.
